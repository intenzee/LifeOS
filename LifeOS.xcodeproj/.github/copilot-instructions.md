# SwiftUI UI Patterns

## Quick start

## When to Use

- When creating or refactoring SwiftUI screens, flows, or reusable UI components.
- When you need guidance on navigation, sheets, async state, previews, or component patterns.

Choose a track based on your goal:

### Existing project

- Identify the feature or screen and the primary interaction model (list, detail, editor, settings, tabbed).
- Find a nearby example in the repo with `rg "TabView\("` or similar, then read the closest SwiftUI view.
- Apply local conventions: prefer SwiftUI-native state, keep state local when possible, and use environment injection for shared dependencies.
- Choose the relevant component reference from `references/components-index.md` and follow its guidance.
- If the interaction reveals secondary content by dragging or scrolling the primary content away, read `references/scroll-reveal.md` before implementing gestures manually.
- Build the view with small, focused subviews and SwiftUI-native data flow.

### New project scaffolding

- Start with `references/app-wiring.md` to wire TabView + NavigationStack + sheets.
- Add a minimal `AppTab` and `RouterPath` based on the provided skeletons.
- Choose the next component reference based on the UI you need first (TabView, NavigationStack, Sheets).
- Expand the route and sheet enums as new screens are added.

## General rules to follow

- Use modern SwiftUI state (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@Observable`, `@Environment`) and avoid unnecessary view models.
- If the deployment target includes iOS 16 or earlier and cannot use the Observation API introduced in iOS 17, fall back to `ObservableObject` with `@StateObject` for root ownership, `@ObservedObject` for injected observation, and `@EnvironmentObject` only for truly shared app-level state.
- Prefer composition; keep views small and focused.
- Use async/await with `.task` and explicit loading/error states. For restart, cancellation, and debouncing guidance, read `references/async-state.md`.
- Keep shared app services in `@Environment`, but prefer explicit initializer injection for feature-local dependencies and models. For root wiring patterns, read `references/app-wiring.md`.
- Prefer the newest SwiftUI API that fits the deployment target and call out the minimum OS whenever a pattern depends on it.
- Maintain existing legacy patterns only when editing legacy files.
- Follow the project's formatter and style guide.
- **Sheets**: Prefer `.sheet(item:)` over `.sheet(isPresented:)` when state represents a selected model. Avoid `if let` inside a sheet body. Sheets should own their actions and call `dismiss()` internally instead of forwarding `onCancel`/`onConfirm` closures.
- **Scroll-driven reveals**: Prefer deriving a normalized progress value from scroll offset and driving the visual state from that single source of truth. Avoid parallel gesture state machines unless scroll alone cannot express the interaction.

## State ownership summary

Use the narrowest state tool that matches the ownership model:

| Scenario | Preferred pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Local UI state owned by one view | `@State` |
| Child mutates parent-owned value state | `@Binding` |
| Root-owned reference model on iOS 17+ | `@State` with an `@Observable` type |
| Child reads or mutates an injected `@Observable` model on iOS 17+ | Pass it explicitly as a stored property |
| Shared app service or configuration | `@Environment(Type.self)` |
| Legacy reference model on iOS 16 and earlier | `@StateObject` at the root, `@ObservedObject` when injected |

Choose the ownership location first, then pick the wrapper. Do not introduce a reference model when plain value state is enough.

## Cross-cutting references

- `references/navigationstack.md`: navigation ownership, per-tab history, and enum routing.
- `references/sheets.md`: centralized modal presentation and enum-driven sheets.
- `references/deeplinks.md`: URL handling and routing external links into app destinations.
- `references/app-wiring.md`: root dependency graph, environment usage, and app shell wiring.
- `references/async-state.md`: `.task`, `.task(id:)`, cancellation, debouncing, and async UI state.
- `references/previews.md`: `#Preview`, fixtures, mock environments, and isolated preview setup.
- `references/performance.md`: stable identity, observation scope, lazy containers, and render-cost guardrails.

## Anti-patterns

- Giant views that mix layout, business logic, networking, routing, and formatting in one file.
- Multiple boolean flags for mutually exclusive sheets, alerts, or navigation destinations.
- Live service calls directly inside `body`-driven code paths instead of view lifecycle hooks or injected models/services.
- Reaching for `AnyView` to work around type mismatches that should be solved with better composition.
- Defaulting every shared dependency to `@EnvironmentObject` or a global router without a clear ownership reason.

## Workflow for a new SwiftUI view

1. Define the view's state, ownership location, and minimum OS assumptions before writing UI code.
2. Identify which dependencies belong in `@Environment` and which should stay as explicit initializer inputs.
3. Sketch the view hierarchy, routing model, and presentation points; extract repeated parts into subviews. For complex navigation, read `references/navigationstack.md`, `references/sheets.md`, or `references/deeplinks.md`. **Build and verify no compiler errors before proceeding.**
4. Implement async loading with `.task` or `.task(id:)`, plus explicit loading and error states when needed. Read `references/async-state.md` when the work depends on changing inputs or cancellation.
5. Add previews for the primary and secondary states, then add accessibility labels or identifiers when the UI is interactive. Read `references/previews.md` when the view needs fixtures or injected mock dependencies.
6. Validate with a build: confirm no compiler errors, check that previews render without crashing, ensure state changes propagate correctly, and sanity-check that list identity and observation scope will not cause avoidable re-renders. Read `references/performance.md` if the screen is large, scroll-heavy, or frequently updated. For common SwiftUI compilation errors — missing `@State` annotations, ambiguous `ViewBuilder` closures, or mismatched generic types — resolve them before updating callsites. **If the build fails:** read the error message carefully, fix the identified issue, then rebuild before proceeding to the next step. If a preview crashes, isolate the offending subview, confirm its state initialisation is valid, and re-run the preview before continuing.

## Component references

Use `references/components-index.md` as the entry point. Each component reference should include:
- Intent and best-fit scenarios.
- Minimal usage pattern with local conventions.
- Pitfalls and performance notes.
- Paths to existing examples in the current repo.

## Adding a new component reference

- Create `references/<component>.md`.
- Keep it short and actionable; link to concrete files in the current repo.
- Update `references/components-index.md` with the new entry.

# SwiftUI View Refactor

## Overview
Refactor SwiftUI views toward small, explicit, stable view types. Default to vanilla SwiftUI: local state in the view, shared dependencies in the environment, business logic in services/models, and view models only when the request or existing code clearly requires one.

## When to Use

- When cleaning up a large SwiftUI view or splitting long `body` implementations.
- When you need smaller subviews, explicit dependency injection, or better Observation usage.

## Core Guidelines

### 1) View ordering (top → bottom)
- Enforce this ordering unless the existing file has a stronger local convention you must preserve.
- Environment
- `private`/`public` `let`
- `@State` / other stored properties
- computed `var` (non-view)
- `init`
- `body`
- computed view builders / other view helpers
- helper / async functions

### 2) Default to MV, not MVVM
- Views should be lightweight state expressions and orchestration points, not containers for business logic.
- Favor `@State`, `@Environment`, `@Query`, `.task`, `.task(id:)`, and `onChange` before reaching for a view model.
- Inject services and shared models via `@Environment`; keep domain logic in services/models, not in the view body.
- Do not introduce a view model just to mirror local view state or wrap environment dependencies.
- If a screen is getting large, split the UI into subviews before inventing a new view model layer.

### 3) Strongly prefer dedicated subview types over computed `some View` helpers
- Flag `body` properties that are longer than roughly one screen or contain multiple logical sections.
- Prefer extracting dedicated `View` types for non-trivial sections, especially when they have state, async work, branching, or deserve their own preview.
- Keep computed `some View` helpers rare and small. Do not build an entire screen out of `private var header: some View`-style fragments.
- Pass small, explicit inputs (data, bindings, callbacks) into extracted subviews instead of handing down the entire parent state.
- If an extracted subview becomes reusable or independently meaningful, move it to its own file.

Prefer:

```swift
var body: some View {
    List {
        HeaderSection(title: title, subtitle: subtitle)
        FilterSection(
            filterOptions: filterOptions,
            selectedFilter: $selectedFilter
        )
        ResultsSection(items: filteredItems)
        FooterSection()
    }
}

private struct HeaderSection: View {
    let title: String
    let subtitle: String

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 6) {
            Text(title).font(.title2)
            Text(subtitle).font(.subheadline)
        }
    }
}

private struct FilterSection: View {
    let filterOptions: [FilterOption]
    @Binding var selectedFilter: FilterOption

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(filterOptions, id: \.self) { option in
                    FilterChip(option: option, isSelected: option == selectedFilter)
                        .onTapGesture { selectedFilter = option }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Avoid:

```swift
var body: some View {
    List {
        header
        filters
        results
        footer
    }
}

private var header: some View {
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 6) {
        Text(title).font(.title2)
        Text(subtitle).font(.subheadline)
    }
}
```

### 3b) Extract actions and side effects out of `body`
- Do not keep non-trivial button actions inline in the view body.
- Do not bury business logic inside `.task`, `.onAppear`, `.onChange`, or `.refreshable`.
- Prefer calling small private methods from the view, and move real business logic into services/models.
- The body should read like UI, not like a view controller.

```swift
Button("Save", action: save)
    .disabled(isSaving)

.task(id: searchText) {
    await reload(for: searchText)
}

private func save() {
    Task { await saveAsync() }
}

private func reload(for searchText: String) async {
    guard !searchText.isEmpty else {
        results = []
        return
    }
    await searchService.search(searchText)
}
```

### 4) Keep a stable view tree (avoid top-level conditional view swapping)
- Avoid `body` or computed views that return completely different root branches via `if/else`.
- Prefer a single stable base view with conditions inside sections/modifiers (`overlay`, `opacity`, `disabled`, `toolbar`, etc.).
- Root-level branch swapping causes identity churn, broader invalidation, and extra recomputation.

Prefer:

```swift
var body: some View {
    List {
        documentsListContent
    }
    .toolbar {
        if canEdit {
            editToolbar
        }
    }
}
```

Avoid:

```swift
var documentsListView: some View {
    if canEdit {
        editableDocumentsList
    } else {
        readOnlyDocumentsList
    }
}
```

### 5) View model handling (only if already present or explicitly requested)
- Treat view models as a legacy or explicit-need pattern, not the default.
- Do not introduce a view model unless the request or existing code clearly calls for one.
- If a view model exists, make it non-optional when possible.
- Pass dependencies to the view via `init`, then create the view model in the view's `init`.
- Avoid `bootstrapIfNeeded` patterns and other delayed setup workarounds.

Example (Observation-based):

```swift
@State private var viewModel: SomeViewModel

init(dependency: Dependency) {
    _viewModel = State(initialValue: SomeViewModel(dependency: dependency))
}
```

### 6) Observation usage
- For `@Observable` reference types on iOS 17+, store them as `@State` in the owning view.
- Pass observables down explicitly; avoid optional state unless the UI genuinely needs it.
- If the deployment target includes iOS 16 or earlier, use `@StateObject` at the owner and `@ObservedObject` when injecting legacy observable models.

## Workflow

1. Reorder the view to match the ordering rules.
2. Remove inline actions and side effects from `body`; move business logic into services/models and keep only thin orchestration in the view.
3. Shorten long bodies by extracting dedicated subview types; avoid rebuilding the screen out of many computed `some View` helpers.
4. Ensure stable view structure: avoid top-level `if`-based branch swapping; move conditions to localized sections/modifiers.
5. If a view model exists or is explicitly required, replace optional view models with a non-optional `@State` view model initialized in `init`.
6. Confirm Observation usage: `@State` for root `@Observable` models on iOS 17+, legacy wrappers only when the deployment target requires them.
7. Keep behavior intact: do not change layout or business logic unless requested.

## Notes

- Prefer small, explicit view types over large conditional blocks and large computed `some View` properties.
- Keep computed view builders below `body` and non-view computed vars above `init`.
- A good SwiftUI refactor should make the view read top-to-bottom as data flow plus layout, not as mixed layout and imperative logic.
- For MV-first guidance and rationale, see `references/mv-patterns.md`.

## Large-view handling

When a SwiftUI view file exceeds ~300 lines, split it aggressively. Extract meaningful sections into dedicated `View` types instead of hiding complexity in many computed properties. Use `private` extensions with `// MARK: -` comments for actions and helpers, but do not treat extensions as a substitute for breaking a giant screen into smaller view types. If an extracted subview is reused or independently meaningful, move it into its own file.

# Swift Concurrency Expert

## Overview

Review and fix Swift Concurrency issues in Swift 6.2+ codebases by applying actor isolation, Sendable safety, and modern concurrency patterns with minimal behavior changes.

## When to Use

- When the user asks to review Swift concurrency usage or fix compiler diagnostics.
- When you need guidance on actor isolation, `Sendable`, `@MainActor`, or async migration.

## Workflow

### 1. Triage the issue

- Capture the exact compiler diagnostics and the offending symbol(s).
- Check project concurrency settings: Swift language version (6.2+), strict concurrency level, and whether approachable concurrency (default actor isolation / main-actor-by-default) is enabled.
- Identify the current actor context (`@MainActor`, `actor`, `nonisolated`) and whether a default actor isolation mode is enabled.
- Confirm whether the code is UI-bound or intended to run off the main actor.

### 2. Apply the smallest safe fix

Prefer edits that preserve existing behavior while satisfying data-race safety.

Common fixes:
- **UI-bound types**: annotate the type or relevant members with `@MainActor`.
- **Protocol conformance on main actor types**: make the conformance isolated (e.g., `extension Foo: @MainActor SomeProtocol`).
- **Global/static state**: protect with `@MainActor` or move into an actor.
- **Background work**: move expensive work into a `@concurrent` async function on a `nonisolated` type or use an `actor` to guard mutable state.
- **Sendable errors**: prefer immutable/value types; add `Sendable` conformance only when correct; avoid `@unchecked Sendable` unless you can prove thread safety.

### 3. Verify the fix

- Rebuild and confirm all concurrency diagnostics are resolved with no new warnings introduced.
- Run the test suite to check for regressions — concurrency changes can introduce subtle runtime issues even when the build is clean.
- If the fix surfaces new warnings, treat each one as a fresh triage (return to step 1) and resolve iteratively until the build is clean and tests pass.

### Examples

**UI-bound type — adding `@MainActor`**

```swift
// Before: data-race warning because ViewModel is accessed from the main thread
// but has no actor isolation
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var title: String = ""
    func load() { title = "Loaded" }
}

// After: annotate the whole type so all stored state and methods are
// automatically isolated to the main actor
@MainActor
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var title: String = ""
    func load() { title = "Loaded" }
}
```

**Protocol conformance isolation**

```swift
// Before: compiler error — SomeProtocol method is nonisolated but the
// conforming type is @MainActor
@MainActor
class Foo: SomeProtocol {
    func protocolMethod() { /* accesses main-actor state */ }
}

// After: scope the conformance to @MainActor so the requirement is
// satisfied inside the correct isolation context
@MainActor
extension Foo: SomeProtocol {
    func protocolMethod() { /* safely accesses main-actor state */ }
}
```

**Background work with `@concurrent`**

```swift
// Before: expensive computation blocks the main actor
@MainActor
func processData(_ input: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    input.map { heavyTransform($0) }   // runs on main thread
}

// After: hop off the main actor for the heavy work, then return the result
// The caller awaits the result and stays on its own actor
nonisolated func processData(_ input: [Int]) async -> [Int] {
    await Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) {
        input.map { heavyTransform($0) }
    }.value
}

// Or, using a @concurrent async function (Swift 6.2+):
@concurrent
func processData(_ input: [Int]) async -> [Int] {
    input.map { heavyTransform($0) }
}
```

description: Audit SwiftUI performance issues from code review and profiling evidence.
risk: safe
source: "Dimillian/Skills (MIT)"
date_added: "2026-03-25"

# SwiftUI Performance Audit

## Quick start

Use this skill to diagnose SwiftUI performance issues from code first, then request profiling evidence when code review alone cannot explain the symptoms.

## When to Use

- When the user reports slow rendering, janky scrolling, layout thrash, or high CPU in SwiftUI.
- When you need a code-first audit plus Instruments guidance if profiling evidence is required.

## Workflow

1. Classify the symptom: slow rendering, janky scrolling, high CPU, memory growth, hangs, or excessive view updates.
2. If code is available, start with a code-first review using `references/code-smells.md`.
3. If code is not available, ask for the smallest useful slice: target view, data flow, reproduction steps, and deployment target.
4. If code review is inconclusive or runtime evidence is required, guide the user through profiling with `references/profiling-intake.md`.
5. Summarize likely causes, evidence, remediation, and validation steps using `references/report-template.md`.

## 1. Intake

Collect:
- Target view or feature code.
- Symptoms and exact reproduction steps.
- Data flow: `@State`, `@Binding`, environment dependencies, and observable models.
- Whether the issue shows up on device or simulator, and whether it was observed in Debug or Release.

Ask the user to classify the issue if possible:
- CPU spike or battery drain
- Janky scrolling or dropped frames
- High memory or image pressure
- Hangs or unresponsive interactions
- Excessive or unexpectedly broad view updates

For the full profiling intake checklist, read `references/profiling-intake.md`.

## 2. Code-First Review

Focus on:
- Invalidation storms from broad observation or environment reads.
- Unstable identity in lists and `ForEach`.
- Heavy derived work in `body` or view builders.
- Layout thrash from complex hierarchies, `GeometryReader`, or preference chains.
- Large image decode or resize work on the main thread.
- Animation or transition work applied too broadly.

Use `references/code-smells.md` for the detailed smell catalog and fix guidance.

Provide:
- Likely root causes with code references.
- Suggested fixes and refactors.
- If needed, a minimal repro or instrumentation suggestion.

## 3. Guide the User to Profile

If code review does not explain the issue, ask for runtime evidence:
- A trace export or screenshots of the SwiftUI timeline and Time Profiler call tree.
- Device/OS/build configuration.
- The exact interaction being profiled.
- Before/after metrics if the user is comparing a change.

Use `references/profiling-intake.md` for the exact checklist and collection steps.

## 4. Analyze and Diagnose

- Map the evidence to the most likely category: invalidation, identity churn, layout thrash, main-thread work, image cost, or animation cost.
- Prioritize problems by impact, not by how easy they are to explain.
- Distinguish code-level suspicion from trace-backed evidence.
- Call out when profiling is still insufficient and what additional evidence would reduce uncertainty.

## 5. Remediate

Apply targeted fixes:
- Narrow state scope and reduce broad observation fan-out.
- Stabilize identities for `ForEach` and lists.
- Move heavy work out of `body` into derived state updated from inputs, model-layer precomputation, memoized helpers, or background preprocessing. Use `@State` only for view-owned state, not as an ad hoc cache for arbitrary computation.
- Use `equatable()` only when equality is cheaper than recomputing the subtree and the inputs are truly value-semantic.
- Downsample images before rendering.
- Reduce layout complexity or use fixed sizing where possible.

Use `references/code-smells.md` for examples, Observation-specific fan-out guidance, and remediation patterns.

## 6. Verify

Ask the user to re-run the same capture and compare with baseline metrics.
Summarize the delta (CPU, frame drops, memory peak) if provided.

## Outputs

Provide:
- A short metrics table (before/after if available).
- Top issues (ordered by impact).
- Proposed fixes with estimated effort.

Use `references/report-template.md` when formatting the final audit.

## References

# SwiftUI Liquid Glass

## Overview
Use this skill to build or review SwiftUI features that fully align with the iOS 26+ Liquid Glass API. Prioritize native APIs (`glassEffect`, `GlassEffectContainer`, glass button styles) and Apple design guidance. Keep usage consistent, interactive where needed, and performance aware.

## When to Use

- When the user wants to adopt or review Liquid Glass in SwiftUI UI.
- When you need correct API usage, fallback handling, or modifier ordering for Liquid Glass.

## Workflow Decision Tree
Choose the path that matches the request:

### 1) Review an existing feature
- Inspect where Liquid Glass should be used and where it should not.
- Verify correct modifier order, shape usage, and container placement.
- Check for iOS 26+ availability handling and sensible fallbacks.

### 2) Improve a feature using Liquid Glass
- Identify target components for glass treatment (surfaces, chips, buttons, cards).
- Refactor to use `GlassEffectContainer` where multiple glass elements appear.
- Introduce interactive glass only for tappable or focusable elements.

### 3) Implement a new feature using Liquid Glass
- Design the glass surfaces and interactions first (shape, prominence, grouping).
- Add glass modifiers after layout/appearance modifiers.
- Add morphing transitions only when the view hierarchy changes with animation.

## Core Guidelines
- Prefer native Liquid Glass APIs over custom blurs.
- Use `GlassEffectContainer` when multiple glass elements coexist.
- Apply `.glassEffect(...)` after layout and visual modifiers.
- Use `.interactive()` for elements that respond to touch/pointer.
- Keep shapes consistent across related elements for a cohesive look.
- Gate with `#available(iOS 26, *)` and provide a non-glass fallback.

## Review Checklist
- **Availability**: `#available(iOS 26, *)` present with fallback UI.
- **Composition**: Multiple glass views wrapped in `GlassEffectContainer`.
- **Modifier order**: `glassEffect` applied after layout/appearance modifiers.
- **Interactivity**: `interactive()` only where user interaction exists.
- **Transitions**: `glassEffectID` used with `@Namespace` for morphing.
- **Consistency**: Shapes, tinting, and spacing align across the feature.

## Implementation Checklist
- Define target elements and desired glass prominence.
- Wrap grouped glass elements in `GlassEffectContainer` and tune spacing.
- Use `.glassEffect(.regular.tint(...).interactive(), in: .rect(cornerRadius: ...))` as needed.
- Use `.buttonStyle(.glass)` / `.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)` for actions.
- Add morphing transitions with `glassEffectID` when hierarchy changes.
- Provide fallback materials and visuals for earlier iOS versions.

## Quick Snippets
Use these patterns directly and tailor shapes/tints/spacing.

```swift
if #available(iOS 26, *) {
    Text("Hello")
        .padding()
        .glassEffect(.regular.interactive(), in: .rect(cornerRadius: 16))
} else {
    Text("Hello")
        .padding()
        .background(.ultraThinMaterial, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16))
}
```

```swift
GlassEffectContainer(spacing: 24) {
    HStack(spacing: 24) {
        Image(systemName: "scribble.variable")
            .frame(width: 72, height: 72)
            .font(.system(size: 32))
            .glassEffect()
        Image(systemName: "eraser.fill")
            .frame(width: 72, height: 72)
            .font(.system(size: 32))
            .glassEffect()
    }
}
```

```swift
Button("Confirm") { }
    .buttonStyle(.glassProminent)
```

description: Debug the current iOS project on a booted simulator with XcodeBuildMCP.

source: "Dimillian/Skills (MIT)"
date_added: "2026-03-25"
---

# iOS Debugger Agent

## Overview
Use XcodeBuildMCP to build and run the current project scheme on a booted iOS simulator, interact with the UI, and capture logs. Prefer the MCP tools for simulator control, logs, and view inspection.

## When to Use

- When the user asks to run, debug, or inspect an iOS app on a simulator.
- When you need simulator UI interaction, screenshots, or runtime logs via XcodeBuildMCP.

## Core Workflow
Follow this sequence unless the user asks for a narrower action.

### 1) Discover the booted simulator
- Call `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__list_sims` and select the simulator with state `Booted`.
- If none are booted, ask the user to boot one (do not boot automatically unless asked).

### 2) Set session defaults
- Call `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__session-set-defaults` with:
  - `projectPath` or `workspacePath` (whichever the repo uses)
  - `scheme` for the current app
  - `simulatorId` from the booted device
  - Optional: `configuration: "Debug"`, `useLatestOS: true`

### 3) Build + run (when requested)
- Call `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__build_run_sim`.
- **If the build fails**, check the error output and retry (optionally with `preferXcodebuild: true`) or escalate to the user before attempting any UI interaction.
- **After a successful build**, verify the app launched by calling `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__describe_ui` or `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__screenshot` before proceeding to UI interaction.
- If the app is already built and only launch is requested, use `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__launch_app_sim`.
- If bundle id is unknown:
  1) `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__get_sim_app_path`
  2) `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__get_app_bundle_id`

## UI Interaction & Debugging
Use these when asked to inspect or interact with the running app.

- **Describe UI**: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__describe_ui` before tapping or swiping.
- **Tap**: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__tap` (prefer `id` or `label`; use coordinates only if needed).
- **Type**: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__type_text` after focusing a field.
- **Gestures**: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__gesture` for common scrolls and edge swipes.
- **Screenshot**: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__screenshot` for visual confirmation.

## Logs & Console Output
- Start logs: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__start_sim_log_cap` with the app bundle id.
- Stop logs: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__stop_sim_log_cap` and summarize important lines.
- For console output, set `captureConsole: true` and relaunch if required.

## Troubleshooting
- If build fails, ask whether to retry with `preferXcodebuild: true`.
- If the wrong app launches, confirm the scheme and bundle id.
- If UI elements are not hittable, re-run `describe_ui` after layout changes.
